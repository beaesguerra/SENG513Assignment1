      <h2 class="subheaders">Stuffed Mushrooms</h2>
      <div class="food-info">
        <p>Stuffed mushrooms are one of my all time favorite foods. 
          They are mushroom caps that are usually filled in with a cream cheese mixture
          that can have a mix of different things in it like: more mushrooms, bacon, seafood (crab, lobster, shrimp),
          or even brocolli. It takes a long time to make yourself, but it is worth the wait!
          Some restaurants that have really good stuffed mushrooms is Red Lobster and the Keg.

          <p>
            There are lots of kinds of hors d'oeuvres. They're very easy to eat and not too filling so you will have enough space for your main course. They can be refershing.
            You could also have many different flavors and pretty much use anything, whether it be meat or vegetables. Since there are many ways you can serve them, you can easily provide
            an assortment of flavors for guests. They are yummy and go well with drinks.

        <h2 class="subheaders">Potato Skins</h2>
        <div class="food-info">
          <p>
            Potato skins are also very good. The ingredients needed are very simple: potatoes and an assorment of toppings such as 
            sour cream, bacon, chives, and cheese. Most pubs and restaurants serve this dish because it is very simple to make. 
            Since the potatoes are hollowed out, it isn't too filling to eat as an appetizer.
