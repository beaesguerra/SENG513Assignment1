        <p>
          French macarons are very yummy and pretty. My favorite flavors that I've tried are vanilla, white chocolate, hazelnut, raspberry,
          and mango. Some of my favorite places to get macarons are Yann Haute and Monplaisir. I would like to try Ollia
          to, hopefully sometime soon! Whenever I get macarons, I like to try different flavors and take a bite from each
          one.

        <p>
          I like cupcakes, but I enjoy decorating cupcakes more. My favorite kind of cupcakes are vanilla, chocolate, oreo, or red
          velvet. I also like when cupcakes have cookie dough hidden in it for a pleasant surprise. My favorite place to
          buy cupcakes from is Crave, which have Princess Cupcakes. I would like to try some cupcakes from other bakeries
          though, like Sweet Relief Pastries.

      <h2 class="subheaders">Fruit Tart</h2>
      <div class="food-info">
        <p>
          Fruit tarts are also one of my favorite desserts, especially because the fruit is so refreshing after a nice filling meal
          and the cream matches well with the fruitiness. Fruit tarts usually have strawberries, blueberries, and kiwis on
          it. I have not tried making them before, but I would like to someday! I have yet to find a restaurant or bakery
          that sells the best fruit tarts.
