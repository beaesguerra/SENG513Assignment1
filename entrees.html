        <p>
          I like seafood pasta because I love seafood and pasta matches well with it and together, it is enough to fill me up. I prefer
          creamy sauce compared to tomato sauce. And this kind of pasta goes very well with garlic bread (I also really like
          garlic bread). The seafood in the pasta could range from prawns, mussels, scallops, or even lobster. Some restaurants
          that have good seafood pasta include: Moxies, Red Lobster, and Milestones.

        <p>
          Eggs benedicts are one of my favorite breakfast foods. Especially with hashbrowns. There are lots of different flavors for
          eggs benedicts. Traditionally, eggs benedicts usually come with ham, poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, and English
          muffins. My all-time favorite eggs benedict is from Vendome Cafe, which has mushrooms.

      <h2 class="subheaders">Tacos</h2>
      <div class="food-info">
        <p>
          I like hard shell tacos. Tacos come with different kinds of meat, but I prefer beef. My favorite part of tacos is that you
          can put as many toppings as you want. My favorite toppings are: sour cream, salsa, cilantro, lettuce, and tomato.
          I prefer homemade tacos and making them at home can be a ton of fun with friends and family!
